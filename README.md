# STA-141A-Final-Project
Hello!

This repository hosts the final group project for my STA 141A Class at UC Davis, taught by Dr. Emmanuela Furfaro. In this project, my group and I conducted a multiple linear regression analysis on data regarding global piracy trends. To do this, we took into account a large amount of descriptive data from a dataset of piracy attacks which took place from January 1993 to December 2020, and found which variables had the highest impact on the prevalence of maritime piracy, and where in the world it was most present at specific points in time.

Thank you!
